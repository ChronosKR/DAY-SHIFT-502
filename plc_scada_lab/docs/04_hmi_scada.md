# Lesson 4 – HMI and SCADA Systems

Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems provide the visual interface between operators and industrial processes.

## What is an HMI?

A **Human Machine Interface (HMI)** is a graphical user interface that allows operators to interact with industrial equipment and processes. It serves as the "window" into your automation system.

### Key Functions:
- **Visualization**: Display process status, values, and trends
- **Control**: Allow operators to start/stop equipment and adjust setpoints
- **Alarming**: Alert operators to abnormal conditions
- **Data Logging**: Record historical data for analysis
- **Security**: Control access to different system functions

## What is SCADA?

**Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)** is a system architecture that combines HMIs with communication networks to monitor and control distributed industrial processes.

### SCADA Components:
- **Master Terminal Unit (MTU)**: Central control station
- **Remote Terminal Units (RTU)**: Field devices and PLCs
- **Communication Network**: Links MTU to RTUs
- **HMI Software**: Operator interface and data presentation
- **Historian**: Long-term data storage and analysis

## HMI Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Primary Information**: Most important data prominently displayed
- **Secondary Information**: Supporting details easily accessible
- **Tertiary Information**: Detailed diagnostics available on demand

### Color Coding Standards
- **Red**: Alarms, emergency stops, critical conditions
- **Yellow/Amber**: Warnings, cautions, abnormal conditions  
- **Green**: Normal operation, running equipment
- **Blue**: Information, operator actions required
- **Gray**: Inactive, disabled, or offline equipment

### Layout Guidelines
- **Consistency**: Same information in same locations across screens
- **Grouping**: Related information visually grouped together
- **Navigation**: Clear, intuitive navigation between screens
- **Responsiveness**: Quick response to operator actions

## Our Simulator as an HMI

Our PLC SCADA Lab interface demonstrates many HMI principles:

### Exercise 1: Process Overview
1. **Observe the main display** - it provides an overview of the entire process
2. **Notice the color coding**:
   - Green indicators show active/running equipment
   - Red shows alarms or faults
   - Blue shows normal process values
3. **Real-time updates** show live process data

### Exercise 2: Operator Controls
1. **Digital Input Buttons**: Simulate operator pushbuttons
   - Start/Stop buttons for equipment control
   - Fault simulation for testing alarm systems
2. **Analog Controls**: Temperature setpoint slider
   - Immediate feedback shows setpoint changes
   - Process responds to operator adjustments

### Exercise 3: Data Visualization
1. **Process Values Section**: 
   - Large, easy-to-read numeric displays
   - Units clearly labeled (°C, kPa, L/min)
   - Color changes based on alarm conditions
2. **Raw Data Display**:
   - Technical view for maintenance personnel
   - Shows actual MODBUS register values
   - Useful for troubleshooting communication issues

## HMI Screen Types

### Overview Screens
- **Purpose**: Show entire process at a glance
- **Content**: Key process indicators, equipment status
- **Users**: Operators, supervisors, management

### Detail Screens  
- **Purpose**: Detailed view of specific equipment or process areas
- **Content**: All relevant parameters, controls, and diagnostics
- **Users**: Operators, maintenance technicians

### Trend Screens
- **Purpose**: Historical data visualization
- **Content**: Time-based graphs of process variables
- **Users**: Process engineers, operators

### Alarm Screens
- **Purpose**: Display and manage system alarms
- **Content**: Active alarms, alarm history, acknowledgment
- **Users**: Operators, maintenance personnel

### Diagnostic Screens
- **Purpose**: Equipment health and troubleshooting information
- **Content**: Device status, communication diagnostics, error logs
- **Users**: Maintenance technicians, engineers

## SCADA Architecture

### Centralized SCADA
- **Structure**: Single central server with multiple HMI clients
- **Advantages**: Centralized data, easier maintenance
- **Disadvantages**: Single point of failure
- **Applications**: Smaller facilities, single-site operations

### Distributed SCADA
- **Structure**: Multiple servers with redundancy and load balancing
- **Advantages**: High availability, scalability
- **Disadvantages**: More complex, higher cost
- **Applications**: Large facilities, multi-site operations

### Cloud-Based SCADA
- **Structure**: SCADA services hosted in the cloud
- **Advantages**: Reduced infrastructure, remote access, scalability
- **Disadvantages**: Internet dependency, security concerns
- **Applications**: Remote monitoring, mobile workforce

## Alarm Management

### Alarm Philosophy
- **Abnormal Condition**: Alarms indicate deviations from normal operation
- **Operator Action**: Each alarm should require or suggest operator action
- **Time Critical**: Alarms should indicate urgency level
- **Rationalized**: Only necessary alarms to avoid alarm floods

### Alarm States
1. **Normal**: No alarm condition present
2. **Unacknowledged**: Alarm active, operator not yet aware
3. **Acknowledged**: Operator aware, condition still present
4. **Return to Normal**: Condition cleared, alarm can be reset

### Exercise 4: Alarm Handling
1. **Create an alarm condition**:
   - Start the motor and pump
   - Let temperature rise above 1200°C (over-temperature alarm)
2. **Observe alarm indication**:
   - Alarm status shows "Over-Temp"
   - Visual indicators change color
   - Alarm output (Coil 3) activates
3. **Clear the alarm**:
   - Reduce temperature setpoint
   - Watch alarm clear when temperature drops

## Data Historian

### Purpose
- **Long-term Storage**: Years of historical process data
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns and optimize processes
- **Reporting**: Generate production and efficiency reports
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory record-keeping requirements

### Data Collection
- **Sampling**: Regular intervals (seconds to minutes)
- **Exception**: Store data only when values change significantly
- **Compression**: Reduce storage requirements while preserving trends
- **Archiving**: Move old data to long-term storage

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- **Firewalls**: Separate control networks from corporate networks
- **VPNs**: Secure remote access for maintenance and monitoring
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate critical control systems
- **Intrusion Detection**: Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### Application Security
- **User Authentication**: Strong passwords, multi-factor authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for different user types
- **Audit Trails**: Log all operator actions and system changes
- **Backup Systems**: Regular backups of configuration and historical data

## Performance Considerations

### Response Time
- **Screen Updates**: 1-2 seconds maximum for operator displays
- **Control Actions**: Immediate response to operator commands
- **Alarm Response**: Sub-second notification of alarm conditions
- **Data Logging**: Consistent sampling without impacting control

### Scalability
- **Tag Capacity**: Plan for future expansion of monitored points
